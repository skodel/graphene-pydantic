# Contributing Guide

You will need:
- Python 3.7 or higher

## Getting started

To get your development environment set up, create and activate a virtual
environment, and install poetry:

```
pipx install poetry
# or with conda
conda install poetry
```

Then install dependencies with poetry:

```sh
poetry install
```

This will install the repo version of
`graphene-pydantic` and then install the development dependencies. Once that
has completed, you can start developing.

## Contributor License Agreement


We require all contributors to sign the [Upside CLA](./CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md).

In simple terms, the CLA affirms that the work you're contributing is original,
that you grant Upside permission to use that work (including license to any
patents necessary), and that Upside may relicense your work for our commercial
products if necessary. Note that this description is a summary and the specific
legal terms should be read directly in the CLA.

The CLA does not change the terms of the standard open source license used by
our software. You are still free to use our projects within your own projects or
businesses, republish modified source, and more. Please reference the license of
this project to learn more.

To sign the CLA, open a pull request as usual. If you haven't signed the CLA
yet, we cannot merge any pull request until the CLA is signed. You only need to
sign the CLA once.
